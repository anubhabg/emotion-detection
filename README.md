# Flask Emotion Recognition Project

This Flask project recognizes emotions from images, either uploaded or captured from the camera, and provides recommendations for music, movies, books, and yoga poses based on the predicted emotion.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd flask_emotion_recognition
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install Flask tensorflow pandas numpy matplotlib opencv-python scikit-learn
    ```

4. Ensure the datasets and models are in place:

    - `datasets/imdb_top_1000.csv`
    - `datasets/data_moods.csv`
    - `datasets/recommendations.json`
    - `datasets/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`
    - `trained_CNN_model.h5`

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the application.

3. On the homepage, you can either upload an image or capture an image using your webcam.

4. Select the mood from the dropdown menu and submit the form.

5. The application will predict the emotion from the image and display recommendations for music, movies, books, and yoga poses based on the predicted emotion.

## Dataset

The following datasets are used in the project:

- `datasets/imdb_top_1000.csv`: Contains IMDb data for top 1000 movies.
- `datasets/data_moods.csv`: Contains music data with moods and popularity.
- `datasets/recommendations.json`: Contains book and yoga recommendations for different moods.
- `datasets/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`: Haar Cascade file for face detection.
